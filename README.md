# Stackoverflow  Question Analysis

# Description
Stack Overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/) is an open community for anyone that codes. It helps members get answers to their toughest coding questions, share knowledge with their coworkers in private, and find their next dream job.

This project uses the Stackoverflow data in Google Cloud BigQuery and transforms for data within dbt; then the analytics are displayed in Looker Studio.

Answering what topics for questions are popular and trending but not being answered, something that could indicate either an opportunity for potential subject matter experts to provide those answers and/or a risk that users posting those questions might become frustrated, churn and look for answers elsewhere.
